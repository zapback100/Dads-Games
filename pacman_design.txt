PAC-MAN CLASSIC – DESIGN SPEC (TEXT FILE VERSION)
(Use / save this whole content as e.g. pacman_design.txt)

--------------------------------------------------
1. CORE GAME LOOP
--------------------------------------------------

1. Player controls Pac-Man in a single-screen maze viewed from above.

2. Objective per level
   - Eat all pellets (small dots + power pellets) to clear the level.
   - When all pellets are eaten, level ends and the next level begins.

3. Hazards
   - Four ghosts patrol the maze.
   - If Pac-Man collides with a non-vulnerable ghost, Pac-Man loses a life.
   - When all lives are lost, the game is over.

4. Power pellets (energizers)
   - Eating a power pellet turns all active ghosts “frightened” (blue) for a short time.
   - In frightened state, ghosts move more erratically and can be eaten by Pac-Man.
   - Eating a frightened ghost removes it from play temporarily and awards bonus points.
   - The ghost’s eyes return to the ghost house, regenerate, and then the ghost re-enters the maze.

5. Bonus fruit
   - Each level has a bonus item (fruit or symbol) that appears briefly in the center corridor, below the ghost house, twice per level.
   - Touching the fruit gives a large score bonus.
   - Fruit disappears after a short time if not collected.

6. Lives and continuation
   - Pac-Man starts with a fixed number of lives (e.g. 3).
   - An extra life is awarded when a score threshold is reached (e.g. 10,000 points).
   - When Pac-Man dies and still has lives remaining, the level restarts with:
     - Maze layout and pellets the same as before death.
     - Ghosts reset to starting positions/house.
     - Score and level preserved.

--------------------------------------------------
2. SCREEN, GRID AND MAZE LAYOUT
--------------------------------------------------

2.1 Coordinate system

1. Screen
   - Original arcade orientation is vertical (portrait).
   - Logical design: treat the playfield as a grid of tiles.

2. Tile grid
   - Maze: 28 columns × 31 rows of walkable/visible tiles (common convention for clones).
   - Each tile can be:
     - Wall (blocked)
     - Empty corridor
     - Corridor with pellet
     - Corridor with power pellet
     - Special (warp tunnel, ghost gate, ghost house interior, etc.)

3. Movement alignment
   - Pac-Man and ghosts move from tile center to tile center.
   - Direction changes are allowed only at tile centers (or at least when aligned to grid).

2.2 Maze contents per level

1. Pellets
   - Approximately 240 small pellets.
   - 4 power pellets, placed in the outer corners of the maze.
   - Total pellets: 244 (small + power).

2. Ghost house
   - Central box in the middle of the maze (roughly center of grid).
   - Contains starting positions for ghosts and respawn area.

3. Warp tunnels
   - One horizontal tunnel on the far left edge and one on the far right edge of the maze, on the same row.
   - Exiting the maze on one side wraps the character to the same row on the opposite side.

2.3 Major layout elements

1. Outer walls and boundaries
   - Solid walls define the boundary of the maze, except for left/right tunnel openings.
   - No path exists outside the defined maze.

2. Central ghost house
   - Rectangular enclosure in the center of the maze.
   - Has a horizontal “gate” tile (or short segment) at the top where ghosts exit/enter.
   - Pac-Man cannot pass through the gate tile in the original; treat it as blocked for Pac-Man, passable only by ghosts.

3. Warp tunnels
   - On the leftmost and rightmost columns of a specific row (mid-height of maze).
   - Special behavior:
     - Entities entering a tunnel have their position wrapped to the opposite side.
     - Ghosts often move slower while in the tunnel than in normal corridors.

4. Corridors and intersections
   - Mostly one-tile-wide corridors.
   - 3-way and 4-way intersections where multiple directions are possible.
   - Some dead ends with pellets to create risk-reward situations.
   - “Loop routes” exist where Pac-Man can circle sections of the maze to dodge ghosts.

5. HUD region
   - Top: score, high score, status messages (e.g. “READY!”, “GAME OVER”).
   - Bottom: lives remaining (Pac-Man icons) and level indicator (fruit icons representing completed levels).

--------------------------------------------------
3. ENTITIES AND THEIR PROPERTIES
--------------------------------------------------

3.1 Pac-Man

1. Movement
   - Always moving at constant speed when possible.
   - Player input chooses desired direction (up/down/left/right).
   - Direction change is buffered:
     - When input is pressed, Pac-Man will turn at the next available tile center if that direction is not blocked by a wall.
   - Pac-Man can stop only if facing a wall and no valid input provides an alternate direction.

2. Collision
   - Pellet collision when Pac-Man’s tile center passes over a tile with a pellet.
   - Ghost collision when Pac-Man and a ghost overlap the same tile center (or sufficiently close in distance).

3. States
   - Normal state:
     - Colliding with a non-frightened ghost causes Pac-Man to die.
   - Powered state (after eating power pellet):
     - Ghosts become vulnerable and can be eaten.
     - Pac-Man’s interaction with frightened ghosts changes from death to ghost-eat.

3.2 Ghosts

There are four ghosts, each with different targeting logic:

1. Blinky (red) – “Chaser”
   - Targets Pac-Man’s current tile in chase mode.
   - Becomes more aggressive and faster as pellets are eaten (“Cruise Elroy” behavior in the original).

2. Pinky (pink) – “Ambusher”
   - Targets a tile a few steps ahead of Pac-Man in his current movement direction, trying to ambush.

3. Inky (cyan) – “Unpredictable”
   - Uses a combination of Pac-Man’s position and Blinky’s position to determine a target tile, resulting in more complex, less predictable behavior.

4. Clyde (orange) – “Shy”
   - Sometimes chases Pac-Man.
   - If he gets too close to Pac-Man, he retreats toward his home corner (lower-left).

Common ghost properties:

1. Movement
   - Move at constant speed along corridors.
   - At each tile center, choose a direction based on their AI mode and available paths.
   - Normally, ghosts do not reverse direction except:
     - When switching between scatter and chase modes.
     - When switching into frightened mode (power pellet).

2. Modes
   - Scatter:
     - Each ghost targets a fixed “corner” area of the maze.
   - Chase:
     - Each ghost uses its personality-specific target logic to pursue Pac-Man.
   - Frightened:
     - Triggered by Pac-Man eating a power pellet.
     - Ghosts turn blue, slow down, and choose semi-random directions at intersections.
     - Pac-Man can eat them for points.
   - Eaten:
     - Ghost body disappears; only eyes remain.
     - Eyes travel at high speed back to ghost house.
     - Once they reach the house center, the ghost respawns in normal form and re-enters the maze.

3.3 Pellets

1. Small pellets (dots)
   - Placed on most walkable tiles.
   - Collected when Pac-Man passes over their tile.
   - Grant a small, fixed amount of score each.

2. Power pellets (energizers)
   - Four per level, placed near the four maze corners.
   - Larger, flashing dots.
   - Eating one:
     - Grants a higher fixed score.
     - Switches ghosts into frightened mode for a limited duration.
     - Causes ghosts to reverse direction.

3.4 Fruit (bonus items)

1. Appearance
   - Fruit appears in the center corridor below the ghost house.
   - Typically appears twice per level:
     - After a certain number of pellets are eaten.
     - After a later pellet threshold.

2. Behavior
   - Fruit persists for a limited time.
   - If Pac-Man touches it, he gains points based on fruit type.
   - If not collected within the duration, it disappears.

3. Fruit progression (typical sequence by level)
   - Level 1: Cherry – low value
   - Level 2: Strawberry – higher
   - Levels 3–4: Orange/Peach
   - Levels 5–6: Apple
   - Levels 7–8: Melon
   - Levels 9–10: Galaxian flagship
   - Levels 11–12: Bell
   - Levels 13+: Key (highest value, repeated)

(Exact point values can be tuned, but usually start at 100 and go up to 5000.)

3.5 Lives and scoring

1. Typical scoring values (you can adjust for your design)
   - Pellet: 10 points.
   - Power pellet: 50 points.
   - Ghosts eaten during one power-pellet period:
     - First ghost: 200
     - Second: 400
     - Third: 800
     - Fourth: 1600
   - Fruit: 100–5000 points depending on type.

2. Extra lives
   - One extra life at a specific score threshold (e.g. 10,000).
   - Number and thresholds can be configurable.

--------------------------------------------------
4. LEVEL PROGRESSION AND DIFFICULTY
--------------------------------------------------

4.1 Maze and levels

1. Maze layout
   - The visible maze layout is the same in every level in the original arcade game.
   - Difficulty changes via speed, timing, and frightened durations rather than new mazes.

2. Level indicator
   - At the bottom of the screen, fruit icons appear, representing completed levels.
   - The current level’s fruit is displayed as well.

4.2 Fruit by level (classic pattern)

1. Standard sequence
   - Level 1: Cherry
   - Level 2: Strawberry
   - Levels 3–4: Orange/Peach
   - Levels 5–6: Apple
   - Levels 7–8: Melon
   - Levels 9–10: Galaxian
   - Levels 11–12: Bell
   - Levels 13+: Key (repeated every level)

2. Implementation
   - Create a lookup table indexed by level:
     - Each entry: fruit type, fruit sprite, fruit score value.
   - For levels beyond last defined fruit, repeat the final entry (Key).

4.3 Speed and behavior scaling

Conceptually:

1. Early levels
   - Pac-Man is slightly faster than ghosts in open corridors.
   - Frightened durations are long after power pellets.
   - Ghosts exit the house relatively slowly at level start.

2. Mid levels
   - Ghost speeds increase.
   - Pac-Man speed may increase slightly, but ghosts gain more.
   - Frightened durations become shorter; fewer opportunities to eat multiple ghosts.

3. High levels
   - Ghosts are very fast.
   - Frightened durations become very short or effectively zero.
   - Ghosts exit the house quickly at level start.
   - Overall difficulty is much higher.

4. Tunable parameters per level
   - Pac-Man speed (normal / frightened / tunnel).
   - Ghost speed (normal / tunnel / frightened).
   - Frightened mode duration.
   - Ghost house exit timing (how long before each ghost leaves at the start or after respawn).

5. Kill screen (original behavior)
   - In the original arcade version, level 256 has a bug that corrupts half the maze and makes it impossible to clear.
   - In a modern design, you can either:
     - Reproduce this “kill screen” as a homage, or
     - Allow infinite progression with capped difficulty.

--------------------------------------------------
5. GHOST MODE SCHEDULING (HIGH-LEVEL)
--------------------------------------------------

Ghosts alternate between Scatter and Chase modes according to a level-specific schedule.

1. Modes
   - Scatter:
     - Each ghost targets a specific corner of the maze.
     - Effect: gives Pac-Man brief breaks from direct pursuit.
   - Chase:
     - Each ghost targets Pac-Man using its personality rules.
     - Effect: high-pressure periods of pursuit.

2. Schedule concept
   - The game runs a global mode timer.
   - For each level, define a list of (mode, duration) pairs, for example:
     - Scatter for X seconds.
     - Chase for Y seconds.
     - Scatter for X2 seconds.
     - Chase for Y2 seconds.
     - After several cycles, stay in Chase mode permanently.

3. Direction reversals
   - When switching between Scatter and Chase modes, all ghosts immediately reverse direction.
   - When switching into Frightened mode (after a power pellet), ghosts also reverse.

4. Frightened mode integration
   - Frightened is an overlay triggered by power pellets:
     - Pauses the Scatter/Chase timer or runs in parallel (design choice).
     - When Frightened ends, ghosts resume whichever mode (Scatter or Chase) the schedule indicates at that time.
   - Direction reversal occurs on:
     - Entering Frightened.
     - Leaving Frightened (to resume Scatter/Chase trajectories).

--------------------------------------------------
6. ADDITIONAL PRESENTATION DETAILS
--------------------------------------------------

1. Intermission cut-scenes
   - Short comedic scenes between certain levels.
   - Typical placements: after levels 2, 5, and 9 (original arcade pattern).
   - Simple cartoon animations showing Pac-Man and ghosts in humorous situations.

2. Attract mode / demo
   - Title screen with:
     - Game logo.
     - Credit / start instructions.
     - Score legend (showing point values for pellets, power pellets, ghosts, and fruit).
   - Non-interactive demo:
     - Pac-Man and ghosts moving in the maze.
     - Demonstrates gameplay loop.
     - Starts automatically after a period of inactivity.

3. Messages
   - “READY!” appears at start of each life.
   - “GAME OVER” appears when no lives remain.
   - Optional: “INSERT COIN,” “PRESS START” on title/attract screen.

--------------------------------------------------
7. PRACTICAL USE FOR YOUR DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------

To build a playable Pac-Man-style game from this document:

1. Data structures
   - Tile map (28×31):
     - Store tile type (wall, empty, pellet, power pellet, tunnel, gate, etc.).
   - Entity data:
     - Pac-Man: position, direction, state (normal/powered).
     - Ghosts: position, direction, current mode, personality type, frightened timer.
     - Fruit: type, active flag, spawn timer.
   - Level parameters:
     - Speeds, frightened duration, scatter/chase schedule, fruit mapping, score thresholds.

2. Logic systems
   - Input handling: maps player inputs to desired directions.
   - Movement:
     - Move entities along grid at speeds defined by level.
     - Allow direction changes when aligned to tile center and not blocked.
   - Collision:
     - Pac-Man vs pellets/power pellets.
     - Pac-Man vs ghosts (state-dependent results).
     - Pac-Man vs fruit.
   - Mode scheduling:
     - Global scatter/chase timer.
     - Power pellet frightened timers per activation.
   - Scoring, lives, and level transitions:
     - Update score on events.
     - Award extra life at threshold.
     - On all pellets cleared, advance level and reset timers/parameters.

3. Rendering
   - Draw maze walls, pellets, fruit, characters, HUD.
   - Animate Pac-Man mouth, ghost eyes and body states (normal, frightened, eyes-only).

--------------------------------------------------
8. AUDIO / SOUND EFFECTS
--------------------------------------------------

8.1 Audio design goals

1. Every major gameplay event has a distinct sound cue:
   - Pellets, power pellets, fruit, ghosts, extra life, death, level start, level end.

2. Continuous background sounds:
   - A siren-like loop that changes with danger level.
   - A distinct frightened loop for power pellet time.

3. Limited channels:
   - Keep to a small number of simultaneous sounds (e.g., background + 2 SFX).

8.2 Continuous background sounds

1. Ghost “siren” loop (normal play)
   - Plays during normal Scatter/Chase mode.
   - Intensity / pitch rises as the level progresses or as more pellets are eaten.
   - Implement 2–4 variants:
     - Siren_Low: early level / low danger.
     - Siren_Mid: mid-level.
     - Siren_High: late level / high danger.
   - Switch variant based on number of pellets remaining or level number.

2. Frightened-mode loop
   - Replaces or overlays the normal siren while ghosts are blue.
   - Characteristics:
     - Slightly lower energy or different pattern to indicate vulnerability.
     - In the final portion of frightened time, the loop can speed up or change pitch to warn the player that ghosts are about to revert.

8.3 Pac-Man sounds (one-shot SFX)

1. Pellet “chomp” / “waka-waka”
   - Trigger: small pellet eaten.
   - Very short blip; alternate between two pitches for “waka-waka” rhythm.
   - Must be frequent but not overwhelming; quiet enough to let other SFX stand out.

2. Power pellet eaten
   - Trigger: power pellet collected.
   - Distinct sound, slightly longer than small pellet sound.
   - Immediately:
     - Switch background from siren to frightened loop.
     - Turn ghosts blue.

3. Fruit collected
   - Trigger: fruit touched by Pac-Man.
   - Bright, rewarding sound (chime or short arpeggio).
   - Should be clearly different from pellets and ghosts eaten.

4. Extra life
   - Trigger: score surpasses extra-life threshold.
   - Short celebratory jingle (1–2 seconds).
   - Can temporarily lower siren volume while it plays.

5. Level complete
   - Trigger: last pellet of the level eaten.
   - Short victory or transition jingle.
   - Maze fade or transition happens during or immediately after this.

6. Pac-Man death
   - Trigger: collision with non-frightened ghost.
   - Iconic “death melody”; all other sounds stop while this plays.
   - After it finishes, handle life decrement and either:
     - Show “GAME OVER”, or
     - Restart level with remaining lives.

7. Game start / level start jingle
   - Trigger:
     - Start of game.
     - Start of each level or restart after death.
   - Short intro melody.
   - Ghosts and Pac-Man remain idle until jingle ends; then gameplay begins and siren starts.

8.4 Ghost-related sounds

1. Ghost frightened state
   - Indicated mainly by the frightened loop.
   - Optional: add a soft ticking layer or understated pulsation to emphasize tempo.

2. Ghost eaten
   - Trigger: Pac-Man collides with a blue ghost.
   - Strong, distinct effect; louder than pellet sounds.
   - If multiple ghosts are eaten under one power pellet, can vary pitch or volume per ghost to match the scoring ramp (200, 400, 800, 1600).

3. Ghost eyes returning
   - Trigger: immediately after ghost is eaten and becomes eyes.
   - Optional:
     - A subtle whoosh or high-pitched glide while the eyes travel back to the house.
     - This can be very minimal or omitted.

4. Ghost respawn
   - Trigger: eyes reach ghost house and body reforms.
   - Very short blip indicating the ghost is back in play.
   - Does not interrupt siren.

8.5 UI and intermission sounds

1. Coin insert / credit (if emulating arcade)
   - Trigger: player adds a credit.
   - Simple “coin” chime.

2. Start button pressed
   - Trigger: player begins game from title screen.
   - Short confirmation beep or mini-jingle; can lead into main start jingle.

3. Intermission / cut-scene themes
   - Trigger: between certain levels.
   - Short playful tunes, each matched to the cartoon animation.
   - No siren during intermission; only the intermission music.

4. Attract mode
   - Can reuse normal gameplay sounds, possibly at lower volume.
   - Alternatively, use only a subset (start jingle, a few chomp sounds, death sound) to keep the attract mode less noisy.

--------------------------------------------------
9. CHARACTER / SPRITE DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------

9.1 General pixel scale and style

1. Pixel art style
   - Use low-resolution sprite art to match the arcade feel.
   - Clean silhouettes with bold, flat colors and minimal shading.

2. Tile and sprite relationship
   - Base tile size: 8×8 or 16×16 pixels depending on your target resolution.
   - Pac-Man and ghosts:
     - Typically occupy one tile horizontally and slightly more than one tile vertically (e.g., 14×14 or 16×16 pixels centered on tile).

3. Animation philosophy
   - Use a small number of frames (2–4) for each repeating animation.
   - Emphasize clear motion readability (mouth opening, eyes direction, ghost wobble, etc.) over complexity.

9.2 Pac-Man visual design

1. Shape and size
   - Basic shape: a filled yellow circle.
   - Size: slightly smaller than the tile, e.g., 14×14 pixels in a 16×16 tile so it has a 1-pixel border around.
   - Center Pac-Man on the tile grid center.

2. Color
   - Body: bright yellow.
   - No outline in the original, but you can add a 1-pixel darker outline for readability on modern screens.

3. Mouth and animation
   - Mouth: a wedge-shaped “slice” removed from the circle.
   - Two primary animation frames per direction:
     - Mouth closed (circle with a minimal notch or no cut).
     - Mouth open (large triangular wedge facing direction of travel).
   - Directions:
     - Right: wedge removed from right side.
     - Left: mirror horizontally.
     - Up: wedge removed from top.
     - Down: wedge removed from bottom.
   - Animation speed:
     - Alternate between open and closed frames as Pac-Man moves.
     - Tie frame change to movement distance rather than time (e.g., change every half-tile or fixed number of pixels) for consistent visual rhythm.

4. Death animation
   - Multiple frames where:
     - Pac-Man’s mouth slowly opens wider and wider until nearly a full circle line.
     - Then collapses into a small line or dot before disappearing.
   - 6–10 frames is enough to convey the full sequence.

9.3 Ghost visual design

1. Base shape
   - Rounded dome on top with a flat bottom.
   - At the bottom, create 3–4 “wave” scallops to simulate a hovering sheet.
   - Width similar to Pac-Man’s diameter; slightly taller vertically (e.g., 14×16 pixels).

2. Base colors by ghost
   - Blinky: red.
   - Pinky: pink.
   - Inky: cyan/light blue.
   - Clyde: orange.

3. Eyes
   - Two large white ovals near the top-center of the body.
   - Blue or dark pupils indicating direction:
     - Change pupil offset to point left/right/up/down depending on ghost movement direction.
   - No mouth in normal mode.

4. Animation
   - Idle/movement: 2-frame animation of the scalloped bottom shifting slightly up and down (wobble).
   - Frame A: scallops pattern slightly high.
   - Frame B: scallops pattern slightly low.
   - Alternate frames as the ghost moves to give a floating effect.

5. Frightened state visuals
   - Body color: blue.
   - Eyes:
     - Simple white circles with small pupils or stylized wide eyes to show fear.
   - Add a small, lighter blue or white highlight for a glowing effect (optional).
   - Near the end of frightened time:
     - Overlay flashing colors (blue + white or blue + original ghost colors) to indicate that frightened mode is about to end.

6. Eaten ghost (eyes only)
   - Remove body; render only eyes.
   - Eyes keep their direction-based pupil offsets while returning to the ghost house.
   - Size: same as normal but without body behind them.

7. Ghost house indicator and gate
   - The gate tile:
     - A small horizontal bar (e.g., white or light-colored) at the entrance.
     - Visually distinct from ordinary wall and corridor tiles.

9.4 Fruit / bonus item visuals

1. Style
   - Small, recognizable silhouettes for each fruit/symbol.
   - Pixel art with 2–4 colors each:
     - Base color.
     - Darker shade for outline.
     - One or two accent colors for details.

2. Examples
   - Cherry:
     - Two small red circles with a shared brown/green stem.
   - Strawberry:
     - Red triangle with green top and small yellow dots for seeds.
   - Orange/Peach:
     - Round orange shape with subtle highlight and small leaf.
   - Apple:
     - Slightly squarer red shape with a top notch and stalk.
   - Melon:
     - Green oval with light stripes.
   - Galaxian:
     - Tiny stylized spaceship in yellow/blue/orange.
   - Bell:
     - Yellow bell shape with clapper hint and highlight.
   - Key:
     - Gold key with simple head and 2–3 teeth.

3. Animation
   - Simple 2-frame animation is optional:
     - Slight vertical bobbing (1–2 pixels) or micro-rotation.
     - Helps draw player attention when fruit appears.

9.5 Pellet and power pellet visuals

1. Small pellet
   - Single small dot centered in corridor tiles.
   - Color: white or pale yellow.
   - Size: 1–2 pixels depending on your scale.

2. Power pellet
   - Larger dot, often 2×2 or 3×3 pixels.
   - Same color as small pellet or slightly more saturated.
   - Flashing:
     - Alternate between bright and dim frames to make it stand out.
     - Frame timing can be slow (e.g., 4–8 frames per flash cycle).

9.6 UI elements and icons

1. Lives icon
   - Small Pac-Man head icon rendered at bottom-left or bottom-center of HUD.
   - Static version of Pac-Man facing right.

2. Level (fruit) indicator
   - A row of mini fruit icons representing past levels.
   - Use simplified, smaller versions of the in-game fruit sprites.

3. Score and high score text
   - Use a blocky, all-caps bitmap font.
   - Colors:
     - White or light gray text on dark background.
